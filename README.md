Archived project.
A way for you to control a mninecraft server with a discord bot - Uses petrodactyl's client API to do so.

Sends commands, starts & stops the server - Runs in node.js separate from the server itself. 

Hence its original name "Night-watchman" - It stays awake even when the server is asleep.

This was a custom solution for a particular community, so it doesn't really have any documentation.
The code is... well... a mess - to say the least - One of the reasons I'm archiving it.

Hopefully it helps some MC server admin in the future looking to administer their server using a discord bot.

Use the bot-mainv2.js not the OG bot-main.js 

Adios, Mashiro!
(This was a side project for a long time, but its time to move on)
